					<img src="images/physics.gif" class="content-img" alt="Basic forces in a car">
					<p>
						Understanding of physics is mandatory in order to understand how components behave in systems,
						and how in the big picture the car will react to its environment. In this unit, we will learn
						how physics are involved in a car so that the driver and the engineering team can
						leverage physics in the most efficient way.

					<h2 class="unit-title">Unit 2: Materials</h2>
					<img src="images/carbon.jpg" class="content-img" alt="Carbon fiber sheet">
					<p>
						The chassis of a car must be as rigid as possible in order to withstand the enormous forces.
						Also, the rubber of a tire should resist high temperatures and be elastic enough so that
						grip is maximized on both linear and lateral accelerations. Every material in our car shall have
						different properties based on their specific functions.
					</p>

					<h2 class="unit-title">Unit 3: Car setups</h2>
					<img src="images/front-sus.jpg" class="content-img" alt="Front suspension of a open-wheeled car">
					<p>
						A difference in millimiters on the maximum travel of a suspension rod can be the difference
						between a car that can be driven to the limit by its driver 0.1 seconds faster around a track,
						and an uncontrollable car that could harm or even kill an experienced driver.
						Setting up a car properly is a vastly complex procedure with many steps and possible combinations,
						so getting it just right is all a matter of experience and communication between the driver and the
						race engineer.

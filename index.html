					<h2 class="unit-title">Unit 1: Racing physics</h2>
					
					<img src="images/physics.gif" class="content-img" alt="Basic forces in a car">
					<p>
						Understanding of physics is mandatory in order to understand how components behave in systems,
						and how in the big picture the car will react to its environment. In this unit, we will learn
						how physics are involved in a car so that the driver and the engineering team can
						leverage physics in the most efficient way.
					</p>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNZksy3r7iU"></iframe>
					<p>
						The suspension system is one of the main key components in controlling the physics of a car.
						It must be adaptable enough to almost any situation the tire is enduring. For example, in a fast bump
						the tire should yield quite considerably, while in a slow rebound we want the tire to return in the
						extended position quite slowly, so that traction is more stable. However, a slow bump must have very
						little resistance so that any imperfection or stone or piano of the track moves the tire easily.
						Should that not be the case, that tire would send quite a large amount of force to the chassis.
					</p>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JjCcFsGLpaM"></iframe>
					<p>
						The traction circle model defines how much grip the tire has. A tire can give grip up to a physical limit.
						You can use 100% of the grip of a tire on acceleration, but 0% on braking or cornering. You can break
						and turn at the same time, but the sum of both can't exceed 100%. That's why, when unskilled drivers reach
						a corner that is too fast, they will slam on the brakes while turning the steering wheel too much, hence
						exceeding the maximum available traction of the tire, making the front tires skid (understeer).
					</p>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CsVg2DE0ef8"></iframe>
					<p>
						Understeer is basically that the car is not turning enough. If the front tires can't have enough grip,
						or if the rear tires are too grippy compared to the front, the car will understeer. Oversteer, on the other hand,
						means that the car is turning too much. Either the front tires are too effective, or the rear is not grippy enough.
						Understeering is more stable, that's why almost every single consumer car is intentionally set for understeer, but
						when understeering happens, it's unavoidable and the driver must be on damage control, minimizing the time the car
						is understeering. Oversteering is much more dangerous in the wrong hands because the car could spin uncontrollably;
						however skilled drivers can correct oversteer if the car is set up properly. Controlled oversteer is the foundation
						on which drifting is built upon.

					<h2 class="unit-title">Unit 2: Materials</h2>
					<img src="images/carbon.jpg" class="content-img" alt="Carbon fiber sheet">
					<p>
						The chassis of a car must be as rigid as possible in order to withstand the enormous forces.
						Also, the rubber of a tire should resist high temperatures and be elastic enough so that
						grip is maximized on both linear and lateral accelerations. Every material in our car shall have
						different properties based on their specific functions.
					</p>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/504I_hJDFck"></iframe>
					<p>
						Carbon fiber is not the strongest material, nor the lightest. It is one of the best materials that offers
						good strength and lightweightedness. It is a composite material, a symbiosis of a flexible but resistant
						fabric that is hardened by cured epoxy resin. It is a rather expensive material, but it can be molded
						to almost any form, making it perfect for a racecar that should be as light and strong as possible.
					</p>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOJkl4Agf4c"></iframe>
					<p>
						A screaming V10 monster like this one must have extremely strong yet lightweight pistons made of exotic
						and very expensive metals in order to reduce inertias that would reduce the maximum RPM and power.
						Also, the temperatures that the pistons, engine block and exhaust manifolds endure are brutal. A regular
						aluminum exhaust would melt at half the speed of the engine.
					</p>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2NyxdBNFe0"></iframe>
					<p>
						F1 brake discs and pads, unsurprisingly, are made of carbon too. F1 engineers set up the cooling ducts
						inside of the wheel rim so that the brakes are cooled the right amount. When the car finishes braking,
						the discs and pads are ar 1200ºC, and when the next corner arrives, the brakes must be around 500ºC to be
						effective. If the brakes are too cold, they will feel the same as if you were using a soap bar to stop the car.
						On the contrary, if the brakes are too hot, they will disintegrate too much and reduce braking effectiveness too.
					</p>

					<h2 class="unit-title">Unit 3: Car setups</h2>
					<img src="images/front-sus.jpg" class="content-img" alt="Front suspension of a open-wheeled car">
					<p>
						A difference in millimiters on the maximum travel of a suspension rod can be the difference
						between a car that can be driven to the limit by its driver 0.1 seconds faster around a track,
						and an uncontrollable car that could harm or even kill an experienced driver.
						Setting up a car properly is a vastly complex procedure with many steps and possible combinations,
						so getting it just right is all a matter of experience and communication between the driver and the
						race engineer.
					</p>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRB9T2ACPRI"></iframe>
					<p>
						A car that can adjust its suspension so that the front spoiler is exactly at the optimal height from the racetrack,
						will have a superior advantage on air flow, making its aerodynamics much more effective. Also, if that suspension
						adapts very well to any condition without any compromise on other areas, the car is going to feel like cheating.
						That's why the Williams FW14B is considered one of the most advanced F1 cars of all time, with ABS, traction control
						and the active suspension described before.
